# Helm Charts
The package manager for Kubernetes

Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

Its a homebrew of Kubernetes in mac, or apt for kubernetes in linux 

> Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

> Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish

> Helm is a graduated project in the CNCF and is maintained by the Helm community

> Helm Packages are referred to as *Charts* - deployable unit for Kubernetes bound applications.

## Helm users Semantic Versioning 
```
https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
```
- When you break existing API, increment the **major** version  
- When you add a feature, increment the **minor** version  
- For bugs or non-feature changes, increment the **patch** version

## Security - Helm Provenance and Integrity / signing charts
- Provenance - place of origin 
- Provenance records are stored in provenance files, which are stored alongside a packaged chart. For example, if a chart is named myapp-1.2.3.tgz, its provenance file will be myapp-1.2.3.tgz.prov
- Integrity / signing charts 
- Provenance files are generated at packaging time (helm package --sign ...), and can be checked by multiple commands, notably helm install --verify
